# ScryfallClipboard

A browser extension that adds clipboard functionality for Scryfall

This project was forked from original creator.
I have made some minor updates to the code by modifying the card name format so that it can be used directly for importing into the [Moxfield](https://moxfield.com/) website.

## Usage

1. Download as zip file and extract
2. Go to [chrome-extension-page](chrome://extensions/)
3. click "Load unpacked" and select extracted folder
